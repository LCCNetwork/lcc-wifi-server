                    This WiFi hotspot is officially hosted by LCC Network. This hotspot is not intended for public use. All users of the hotspot
                    have registered previous to the beginning of the bus trip. Additionally, we ask that every user install an
                    application on their devices in order to utilize the WiFi provided. Download links for these applications are provided below.
